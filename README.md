# resourceify
A quick website developed for my university web development module. Not all features of the website are functional, just enough for it to meet the requirements of the assessment and then a few extra things to make it look/feel better.

The project was to create a website that would help people get into/advance their computing skills in any discipline, for this I chose a website where valuable tools and resources could be compiled into one location, making it easier for new and experienced persons to find things to help their workflow.
